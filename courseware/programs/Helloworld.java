// Welcome to your first programming exercise! This is the Udacity IDE or 
// "Integrated Development Environment," where you submit your code.

// If you have BlueJ installed, it is a good idea to use it for programming. Then
// you just paste the solution here. For this assignment, start out with this
// BlueJ project: lesson1/twoLineHello

// Look for lines that begin with two slashes! These are "comments" and 
// we will use them to let you know what you should do on each programming
// exercise. Have fun!


public class HelloWorld
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        // Write your code to print "Hello" and "World" on separate lines below
        // Hint: You can use System.out.println("your text here");
        // Hint2: You may need to write two lines of code.
        //
        // Type your code below this line here.
        //
        // Once you are happy with your code, you can hit the "test" button to 
        // try out your code. And once you have the correct results, you can use
        // the submit button to formally submit your code.
        System.out.println("Hello");
        System.out.println("World");
        
    }
